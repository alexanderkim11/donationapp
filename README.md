# Pocket Pal: A Micro-Donation App
Pocket Pal is a web application designed to encourage people to connect with their broader community through donation and volunteering initiatives. The application allows users to donate to a cause of their choosing and engage with volunteering opportunities.

## How to Donate

To donate to a cause via Pocket Pal, you can go to the "View Causes" page to see which causes you wish to donate to. Next, return to the home page, and scroll down to the donation form. After choosing to donate a certain amount, you will be taken to another page where you can donate with PayPal or a credit card.

You can check your donation progress on the profile page by checking your transaction history, trophies, and your current level.

## How to Volunteer

To donate, go to "View Volunteer Opportunities" page to analyze the available volunteer opportunities. Then return to the home page and scroll down to the volunteer form. You can sign up for the desired volunteer opportunity.

Check out your upcoming volunteer on your profile page.


## How to Create a Volunteer Opportunity

Go to the "View Volunteer Opportunities" page, and click on the link to create your own volunteer opportunity. Fill out the required information and click "Submit". You can view your newly created volunteer opportunity on the "View Volunteer Opportunities" page.

## Gamification: Levels and Trophies

Pocket Pal has implemented a leveling system to encourage and incentivize users to donate and engage with the app. The "Trophy Case" in the profile page represent the milestones the user has achieved through donating certain amounts. Furthermore, the more the users have donated to causes, the higher the level they will reach.
